    "The aim of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the frequency distribution of words within H. G. Wellʼs novel The Time Machine. By employing simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies, the project seeks to identify and quantify the most frequently used words in the text. This analysis uses key techniques for handling, processing, and analyzing unstructured textual data, which constitutes a significant portion of global data resources."

      "\n",
      "The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was\n",
      "expounding a recondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone and twinkled, and\n",
      "his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burnt brightly,\n",
      "and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver\n",
      "caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs,\n",
      "being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat\n",
      "upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere, when thought\n",
      "runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in\n",
      "this way—marking the points with a lean forefinger—as we sat\n",
      "and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it)\n",
      "and his fecundity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or\n",
      "two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,\n",
      "they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin\n",
      "upon?” said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable\n",
      "ground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of\n",
      "course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness nil, has no\n",
      "real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane.\n",
      "These things are mere abstractions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is all right,” said the Psychologist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have\n",
      "a real existence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body\n",
      "may exist. All real things—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an\n",
      "instantaneous cube exist?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t follow you,” said Filby.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real\n",
      "existence?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Filby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller\n",
      "proceeded, “any real body must have extension in four\n",
      "directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration.\n",
      "But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you\n",
      "in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four\n",
      "dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth,\n",
      "Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between\n",
      "the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our\n",
      "consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from\n",
      "the beginning to the end of our lives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to\n",
      "relight his cigar over the lamp; “that . . . very clear\n",
      "indeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively\n",
      "overlooked,” continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of\n",
      "cheerfulness. “Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension,\n",
      "though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they\n",
      "mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. There is no\n",
      "difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except\n",
      "that our consciousness moves along it. But some foolish people have got\n",
      "hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to\n",
      "say about this Fourth Dimension?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not,” said the Provincial Mayor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is\n",
      "spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth,\n",
      "and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three planes, each\n",
      "at right angles to the others. But some philosophical people have been\n",
      "asking why three dimensions particularly—why not another\n",
      "direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even tried to\n",
      "construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding\n",
      "this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know\n",
      "how on a flat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a\n",
      "figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by\n",
      "models of three dimensions they could represent one of four—if they\n",
      "could master the perspective of the thing. See?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting\n",
      "his brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one\n",
      "who repeats mystic words. “Yes, I think I see it now,” he said\n",
      "after some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this\n",
      "geometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious.\n",
      "For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at\n",
      "fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All\n",
      "these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations\n",
      "of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Scientific people,” proceeded the Time Traveller, after the\n",
      "pause required for the proper assimilation of this, “know very well\n",
      "that Time is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a\n",
      "weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the\n",
      "barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this\n",
      "morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the mercury did\n",
      "not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognised?\n",
      "But certainly it traced such a line, and that line, therefore, we must\n",
      "conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“But,” said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the\n",
      "fire, “if Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it,\n",
      "and why has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot\n",
      "we move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of\n",
      "Space?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Time Traveller smiled. “Are you so sure we can move freely in\n",
      "Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and\n",
      "men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But how\n",
      "about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not exactly,” said the Medical Man. “There are\n",
      "balloons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the\n",
      "inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical\n",
      "movement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the\n",
      "Medical Man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Easier, far easier down than up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the\n",
      "present moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where\n",
      "the whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present\n",
      "moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions,\n",
      "are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the\n",
      "cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel down if we began our\n",
      "existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the\n",
      "Psychologist. ’You can move about in all directions of Space,\n",
      "but you cannot move about in Time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say\n",
      "that we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an\n",
      "incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become\n",
      "absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course we have no\n",
      "means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than a savage or an\n",
      "animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilised man is\n",
      "better off than the savage in this respect. He can go up against\n",
      "gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may\n",
      "be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even\n",
      "turn about and travel the other way?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, this,” began Filby, “is\n",
      "all—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?” said the Time Traveller.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What reason?” said the Time Traveller.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "“but you will never convince me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Possibly not,” said the Time Traveller. “But now you\n",
      "begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of Four\n",
      "Dimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine—”\n",
      "\n",

      "“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then there is the future,” said the Very Young Man.\n",

      "The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and\n",
      "with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of the\n",
      "room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his\n",
      "laboratory.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Psychologist looked at us. “I wonder what he’s\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Medical Man,\n",
      "and Filby tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before\n",
      "he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s\n",

      "\n",

      "II.\n",
      "The Machine\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic\n",
      "framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made.\n",
      "There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance. And now\n",
      "I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his explanation is\n",
      "to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He took one of\n",
      "the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room, and set it\n",
      "in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he\n",
      "placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other\n",
      "object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell\n",
      "upon the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass\n",
      "candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that the room was\n",
      "brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I\n",
      "drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Traveller and the\n",
      "fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man\n",
      "and the Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the\n",
      "Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the\n",
      "Psychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me that\n",
      "any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly done,\n",
      "could have been played upon us under these conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism.\n",
      "“Well?” said the Psychologist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“This little affair,” said the Time Traveller, resting his\n",
      "elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus,\n",
      "“is only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time.\n",
      "You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd\n",
      "twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way\n",
      "unreal.” He pointed to the part with his finger. “Also, here is\n",
      "one little white lever, and here is another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.\n",
      "“It’s beautifully made,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It took two years to make,” retorted the Time Traveller.\n",
      "Then, when we had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said:\n",
      "“Now I want you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed\n",
      "over, sends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses\n",
      "the motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently\n",
      "I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It will vanish,\n",
      "pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a good look at the thing. Look\n",
      "at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no trickery. I\n",
      "don’t want to waste this model, and then be told I’m a\n",
      "quack.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a minute’s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about\n",
      "to speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth his\n",
      "finger towards the lever. “No,” he said suddenly. “Lend\n",
      "me your hand.” And turning to the Psychologist, he took that\n",
      "individual’s hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger.\n",
      "So that it was the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time\n",
      "Machine on its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am\n",
      "absolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and\n",
      "the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and\n",
      "the little machine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a\n",
      "ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and\n",
      "ivory; and it was gone—vanished! Save for the lamp the table was\n",
      "bare.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under\n",
      "the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully.\n",
      "“Well?” he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then,\n",
      "getting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to\n",
      "us began to fill his pipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stared at each other. “Look here,” said the Medical Man,\n",
      "“are you in earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that\n",
      "machine has travelled into time?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly,” said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a\n",
      "spill at the fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the\n",
      "Psychologist’s face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not\n",
      "unhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.)\n",
      "“What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished in\n",
      "there”—he indicated the laboratory—“and when that\n",
      "is put together I mean to have a journey on my own account.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "“Why?” said the Time Traveller.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it\n",

      "\n",

      "“Not a bit,” said the Time Traveller, and, to the\n",

      "presentation.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“Of course,” said the Psychologist, and reassured us.\n",
      "“That’s a simple point of psychology. I should have thought of\n",
      "it. It’s plain enough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot\n",
      "see it, nor can we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke\n",
      "of a wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is\n",
      "travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are,\n",
      "if it gets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression\n",
      "it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it\n",
      "would make if it were not travelling in time. That’s plain\n",
      "enough.” He passed his hand through the space in which the machine\n",
      "had been. “You see?” he said, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the Time\n",

      "Time Traveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way\n",
      "down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly the\n",
      "flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of the\n",
      "shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how there in\n",
      "the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little mechanism which we\n",
      "had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory,\n",
      "parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing was\n",
      "generally complete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon\n",
      "the bench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better\n",

      "I think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time Machine.\n",
      "The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are too clever to\n",
      "be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him; you always\n",
      "suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush, behind his lucid\n",
      "frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the Time\n",
      "Traveller’s words, we should have shown him far less\n",
      "scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a pork-butcher could\n",
      "understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of whim\n",
      "among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things that would have made the\n",
      "fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to\n",
      "do things too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt\n",
      "quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting their\n",
      "reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with\n",
      "eggshell china. So I don’t think any of us said very much about time\n",
      "travelling in the interval between that Thursday and the next, though its\n",
      "odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our minds: its plausibility,\n",
      "that is, its practical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of\n",
      "anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was\n",
      "particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model. That I remember\n",
      "discussing with the Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linnæan. He\n",
      "said he had seen a similar thing at Tübingen, and laid considerable stress\n",

      "The next Thursday I went again to Richmond—I suppose I was one of\n",
      "the Time Traveller’s most constant guests—and, arriving late,\n",
      "found four or five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical\n",
      "Man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his\n",
      "watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself who\n",
      "had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editor\n",
      "aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another—a quiet, shy man\n",
      "with a beard—whom I didn’t know, and who, as far as my\n",
      "observation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some\n",
      "speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller’s absence,\n",
      "and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor\n",
      "wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden\n",
      "account of the “ingenious paradox and trick” we had witnessed\n",
      "that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the\n",
      "corridor opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it\n",
      "first. “Hallo!” I said. “At last!” And the door\n",
      "opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of\n",
      "surprise. “Good heavens! man, what’s the matter?” cried\n",
      "the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tableful turned towards\n",
      "the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared\n",
      "with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to me\n",
      "greyer—either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually\n",
      "faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it—a\n",
      "cut half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense\n",
      "suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been\n",
      "dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just such\n",
      "a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in silence,\n",
      "expecting him to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion\n",
      "towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it\n",
      "towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked\n",
      "round the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his face.\n",
      "“What on earth have you been up to, man?” said the Doctor. The\n",
      "Time Traveller did not seem to hear. “Don’t let me disturb\n",
      "you,” he said, with a certain faltering articulation.\n",
      "“I’m all right.” He stopped, held out his glass for more,\n",
      "and took it off at a draught. “That’s good,” he said. His\n",
      "eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance\n",
      "flickered over our faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round\n",
      "the warm and comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were\n",
      "feeling his way among his words. “I’m going to wash and dress,\n",
      "and then I’ll come down and explain things.... Save me some of that\n",
      "mutton. I’m starving for a bit of meat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he was\n",
      "all right. The Editor began a question. “Tell you presently,”\n",
      "said the Time Traveller. “I’m—funny! Be all right in a\n",
      "minute.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I\n",
      "remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and\n",
      "standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing on\n",
      "them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door closed upon\n",
      "him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he detested any\n",
      "fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was wool-gathering.\n",
      "Then, “Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,” I heard\n",
      "the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this brought my\n",
      "attention back to the bright dinner-table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s the game?” said the Journalist. “Has he\n",
      "been doing the Amateur Cadger? I don’t follow.” I met the eye\n",
      "of the Psychologist, and read my own interpretation in his face. I thought\n",
      "of the Time Traveller limping painfully upstairs. I don’t think\n",
      "anyone else had noticed his lameness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man,\n",
      "who rang the bell—the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting\n",
      "at dinner—for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and\n",
      "fork with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was\n",
      "resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of\n",
      "wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. “Does\n",
      "our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his\n",
      "Nebuchadnezzar phases?” he inquired. “I feel assured it’s\n",
      "this business of the Time Machine,” I said, and took up the\n",
      "Psychologist’s account of our previous meeting. The new guests were\n",
      "frankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. “What was\n",
      "this time travelling? A man couldn’t cover himself with dust by\n",
      "rolling in a paradox, could he?” And then, as the idea came home to\n",
      "him, he resorted to caricature. Hadn’t they any clothes-brushes in\n",
      "the Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and joined\n",
      "the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They\n",
      "were both the new kind of journalist—very joyous, irreverent young\n",
      "men. “Our Special Correspondent in the Day after Tomorrow\n",
      "reports,” the Journalist was saying—or rather\n",
      "shouting—when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in\n",
      "ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained of the\n",
      "change that had startled me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say,” said the Editor hilariously, “these chaps\n",
      "here say you have been travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all\n",
      "about little Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word. He\n",
      "smiled quietly, in his old way. “Where’s my mutton?” he\n",
      "said. “What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Story!” cried the Editor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Story be damned!” said the Time Traveller. “I want\n",
      "something to eat. I won’t say a word until I get some peptone into my\n",
      "arteries. Thanks. And the salt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“One word,” said I. “Have you been time\n",
      "travelling?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding\n",
      "his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,” said\n",
      "the Editor. The Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and\n",
      "rang it with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring\n",
      "at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the\n",
      "dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising\n",
      "to my lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist\n",
      "tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The\n",
      "Time Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the\n",
      "appetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the\n",
      "Time Traveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more\n",
      "clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination\n",
      "out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away,\n",
      "and looked round us. “I suppose I must apologise,” he said.\n",
      "“I was simply starving. I’ve had a most amazing time.” He\n",
      "reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. “But come into the\n",
      "smoking-room. It’s too long a story to tell over greasy\n",
      "plates.” And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the\n",
      "adjoining room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the\n",
      "machine?” he said to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming\n",
      "the three new guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the thing’s a mere paradox,” said the Editor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t argue tonight. I don’t mind telling you the\n",
      "story, but I can’t argue. I will,” he went on, “tell you\n",
      "the story of what has happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain\n",
      "from interruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like\n",
      "lying. So be it! It’s true—every word of it, all the same. I\n",
      "was in my laboratory at four o’clock, and since then … I’ve\n",
      "lived eight days … such days as no human being ever lived before! I’m\n",
      "nearly worn out, but I shan’t sleep till I’ve told this thing\n",
      "over to you. Then I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it\n",
      "agreed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Agreed,” said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed\n",
      "“Agreed.” And with that the Time Traveller began his story as I\n",
      "have set it forth. He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a\n",
      "weary man. Afterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with\n",
      "only too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink—and, above all,\n",
      "my own inadequacy—to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,\n",
      "attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker’s white, sincere\n",
      "face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonation of\n",
      "his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his\n",
      "story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the\n",
      "smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalist and\n",
      "the legs of the Silent Man from the knees downward were illuminated. At\n",
      "first we glanced now and again at each other. After a time we ceased to do\n",
      "that, and looked only at the Time Traveller’s face.\n",

      "“I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time\n",
      "Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the\n",
      "workshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the\n",
      "ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it’s\n",
      "sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when the\n",
      "putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel bars was\n",
      "exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so that the thing\n",
      "was not complete until this morning. It was at ten o’clock today\n",
      "that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I gave it a last tap,\n",
      "tried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and\n",
      "sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his\n",
      "skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I\n",
      "took the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other,\n",
      "pressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I\n",
      "felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round, I saw the\n",
      "laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For a moment I\n",
      "suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted the clock. A\n",
      "moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute or so past ten; now\n",
      "it was nearly half-past three!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with\n",
      "both hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went\n",
      "dark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me,\n",
      "towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse\n",
      "the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I\n",
      "pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the\n",
      "turning out of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The laboratory\n",
      "grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrow night came\n",
      "black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and faster still. An\n",
      "eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended\n",
      "on my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time\n",
      "travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly\n",
      "like that one has upon a switchback—of a helpless headlong motion! I\n",
      "felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I put on\n",
      "pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The dim\n",
      "suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I\n",
      "saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and\n",
      "every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had been destroyed\n",
      "and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding,\n",
      "but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things. The\n",
      "slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling\n",
      "succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then,\n",
      "in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her\n",
      "quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars.\n",
      "Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night\n",
      "and day merged into one continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful\n",
      "deepness of blue, a splendid luminous colour like that of early twilight;\n",
      "the jerking sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the\n",
      "moon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save\n",
      "now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hillside\n",
      "upon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and\n",
      "dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown, now\n",
      "green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw huge buildings\n",
      "rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The whole surface of the\n",
      "earth seemed changed—melting and flowing under my eyes. The little\n",
      "hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and\n",
      "faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and down, from\n",
      "solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that consequently my pace\n",
      "was over a year a minute; and minute by minute the white snow flashed\n",
      "across the world, and vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green\n",
      "of spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now.\n",
      "They merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked,\n",
      "indeed, a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to account.\n",
      "But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind of madness\n",

      "fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising\n",
      "about me, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it\n",
      "seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the\n",
      "hillside, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even through\n",

      "jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant\n",
      "bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle\n",
      "that a profound chemical reaction—possibly a far-reaching\n",

      "the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerves. I told\n",
      "myself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I resolved to\n",
      "stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over the lever, and\n",

      "sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything still\n",
      "seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was\n",
      "gone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a\n",
      "garden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their mauve\n",
      "and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the\n",
      "hailstones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a little cloud over the\n",

      "for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in\n",
      "shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being\n",
      "carried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to hover.\n",
      "The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick with\n",

      "seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It\n",
      "was greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of\n",
      "disease. I stood looking at it for a little space—half a minute,\n",
      "perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail\n",
      "drove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a\n",
      "moment, and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky\n",
      "was lightening with the promise of the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full\n",

      "high—clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather\n",
      "belt. Sandals or buskins—I could not clearly distinguish\n",
      "which—were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head\n",
      "was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm the air\n",
      "was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful\n",
      "kind of consumptive—that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so\n",

      "“There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps\n",

      "harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears,\n",
      "shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my\n",
      "hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders.\n",
      "They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in this at all\n",
      "alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people that\n",

      "further peculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their\n",
      "hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek;\n",
      "there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears\n",
      "were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather thin\n",
      "lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and mild;\n",

      "always anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred and Two\n",
      "Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art,\n",
      "everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed him\n",
      "to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old\n",
      "children—asked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in a\n",
      "thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon their clothes,\n",

      "and bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful\n",
      "flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The idea was\n",
      "received with melodious applause; and presently they were all running to\n",

      "almost smothered with blossom. You who have never seen the like can\n",
      "scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of\n",
      "culture had created. Then someone suggested that their plaything should be\n",
      "exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of\n",

      "mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw over their heads was a\n",
      "tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a long neglected and yet\n",
      "weedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers,\n",

      "scattered, as if wild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did\n",

      "coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The floor\n",
      "was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal, not plates nor\n",
      "slabs—blocks, and it was so much worn, as I judged by the going to\n",
      "and fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled along the more\n",
      "frequented ways. Transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of\n",
      "slabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a foot from the floor, and upon\n",
      "these were heaps of fruits. Some I recognised as a kind of hypertrophied\n",

      "“Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Upon\n",

      "lower end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that the corner of the\n",
      "marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless, the general effect was\n",
      "extremely rich and picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple of hundred\n",
      "people dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near to me as they\n",
      "could come, were watching me with interest, their little eyes shining over\n",

      "jumped up and ran on, with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the\n",

      "perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young man. I cursed aloud, as I\n",

      "of a match. For they had forgotten about matches. ‘Where is my Time\n",
      "Machine?’ I began, bawling like an angry child, laying hands upon them and\n",
      "shaking them up together. It must have been very queer to them. Some\n",
      "laughed, most of them looked sorely frightened. When I saw them standing\n",
      "round me, it came into my head that I was doing as foolish a thing as it\n",
      "was possible for me to do under the circumstances, in trying to revive the\n",
      "sensation of fear. For, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought\n",
      "that fear must be forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "over in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, out\n",
      "under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little feet running\n",
      "and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all I did as the moon\n",
      "crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected nature of my loss that\n",
      "maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind—a strange\n",
      "animal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro, screaming and\n",
      "crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory of horrible fatigue, as the long\n",
      "night of despair wore away; of looking in this impossible place and that;\n",
      "of groping among moonlit ruins and touching strange creatures in the black\n",
      "shadows; at last, of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with\n",
      "absolute wretchedness, even anger at the folly of leaving the machine\n",
      "having leaked away with my strength. I had nothing left but misery. Then I\n",
      "slept, and when I woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were\n",
      "hopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I\n",
      "had got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and\n",
      "despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain, reasonable\n",
      "daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the face. I saw the wild\n",
      "folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could reason with myself.\n",
      "‘Suppose the worst?’ I said. ‘Suppose the machine\n",
      "altogether lost—perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be calm and\n",
      "patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear idea of the method\n",
      "of my loss, and the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the\n",
      "end, perhaps, I may make another.’ That would be my only hope, a poor\n",

      "\n",

      "cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about me,\n",
      "wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and travel-soiled. The\n",
      "freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness. I had exhausted\n",
      "my emotion. Indeed, as I went about my business, I found myself wondering\n",
      "at my intense excitement overnight. I made a careful examination of the\n",
      "ground about the little lawn. I wasted some time in futile questionings,\n",
      "conveyed, as well as I was able, to such of the little people as came by.\n",
      "They all failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid, some\n",
      "thought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the hardest task in the\n",
      "world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It was a foolish\n",
      "impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger was ill curbed and\n",
      "still eager to take advantage of my perplexity. The turf gave better\n",
      "counsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about midway between the pedestal\n",
      "of the sphinx and the marks of my feet where, on arrival, I had struggled\n",
      "with the overturned machine. There were other signs of removal about, with\n",
      "queer narrow footprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This\n",
      "directed my closer attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have\n",
      "said, of bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep\n",
      "framed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The pedestal was\n",
      "hollow. Examining the panels with care I found them discontinuous with the\n",
      "frames. There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if they\n",
      "were doors, as I supposed, opened from within. One thing was clear enough\n",
      "to my mind. It took no very great mental effort to infer that my Time\n",
      "Machine was inside that pedestal. But how it got there was a different\n",
      "problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the\n",
      "bushes and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned\n",
      "smiling to them, and beckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to\n",
      "the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open it. But at my\n",
      "first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I don’t know how\n",
      "to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use a grossly\n",
      "improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman—it is how she would look.\n",
      "They went off as if they had received the last possible insult. I tried a\n",
      "sweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the same result.\n",
      "Somehow, his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as you know, I\n",
      "wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As he turned off, like\n",
      "the others, my temper got the better of me. In three strides I was after\n",
      "him, had him by the loose part of his robe round the neck, and began\n",
      "dragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze\n",
      "panels. I thought I heard something stir inside—to be explicit, I\n",

      "Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had\n",
      "flattened a coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powdery\n",
      "flakes. The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty\n",
      "outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd\n",
      "of them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I\n",

      "even then in my mind. But I said to myself, ‘You are in for it\n",

      "that there was any need to economise them, and I had wasted almost half the\n",
      "box in astonishing the Overworlders, to whom fire was a novelty. Now, as\n",
      "I say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark, a hand touched mine,\n",

      "unpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those\n",
      "dreadful little beings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being\n",
      "gently disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The\n",
      "sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably unpleasant.\n",
      "The sudden realisation of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing\n",

      "again. They clutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds to each\n",
      "other. I shivered violently, and shouted again—rather discordantly.\n",
      "This time they were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer\n",
      "laughing noise as they came back at me. I will confess I was horribly\n",
      "frightened. I determined to strike another match and escape under the\n",
      "protection of its glare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap\n",
      "of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But I\n",
      "had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blackness I\n",

      "burnt through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay down on the\n",
      "edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy. Then I felt\n",
      "sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped\n",

      "it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now, and,\n",

      "servants: but that had long since passed away. The two species that had\n",
      "resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down towards, or had\n",
      "already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The Eloi, like the\n",
      "Carlovignan kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful futility. They still\n",
      "possessed the earth on sufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for\n",
      "innumerable generations, had come at last to find the daylit surface\n",
      "intolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and\n",
      "maintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the survival of an\n",
      "old habit of service. They did it as a standing horse paws with his foot,\n",
      "or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport: because ancient and departed\n",
      "necessities had impressed it on the organism. But, clearly, the old order\n",

      "on apace. Ages ago, thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his\n",
      "brother man out of the ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was\n",

      "into my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the Underworld. It\n",
      "seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the\n",
      "current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a question from\n",
      "outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had a vague sense of something\n",

      "many side windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The\n",
      "tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous\n",
      "objects was shrouded in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing\n",
      "strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly the lower\n",

      "possibly historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me, at least\n",
      "in my present circumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than\n",
      "this spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another\n",
      "short gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be\n",

      "running on gunpowder. But I could find no saltpetre; indeed, no nitrates of\n",
      "any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in\n",
      "my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of\n",
      "that gallery, though on the whole they were the best preserved of all I\n",
      "saw, I had little interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on\n",
      "down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had entered.\n",
      "Apparently this section had been devoted to natural history, but everything\n",
      "had long since passed out of recognition. A few shrivelled and blackened\n",
      "vestiges of what had once been stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars\n",
      "that had once held spirit, a brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I\n",
      "was sorry for that, because I should have been glad to trace the patient\n",
      "readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been attained.\n",
      "Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly\n",
      "ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the end at\n",
      "which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from the ceiling—many\n",
      "of them cracked and smashed—which suggested that originally the place\n",
      "had been artificially lit. Here I was more in my element, for rising on\n",
      "either side of me were the huge bulks of big machines, all greatly corroded\n",
      "and many broken down, but some still fairly complete. You know I have a\n",
      "certain weakness for mechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these;\n",
      "the more so as for the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I\n",
      "could make only the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that\n",

      "that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It may be, of\n",
      "course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum was built into\n",
      "the side of a hill.—ED.] The end I had come in at was quite above\n",
      "ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went down the length,\n",
      "the ground came up against these windows, until at last there was a pit\n",
      "like the ‘area‘ of a London house before each, and only a\n",
      "narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling about the\n",
      "machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the gradual\n",
      "diminution of the light, until Weena’s increasing apprehensions drew\n",
      "my attention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a thick\n",
      "darkness. I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust\n",
      "was less abundant and its surface less even. Further away towards the\n",
      "dimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints.\n",
      "My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that. I felt\n",

      "called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon, and that\n",
      "I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of making a fire. And then\n",

      "those in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this lever\n",
      "in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted\n",
      "in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of the\n",
      "lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute’s strain, and I\n",
      "rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged, for any\n",
      "Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill a Morlock\n",
      "or so. Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killing one’s own\n",
      "descendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the\n",
      "things. Only my disinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if I\n",
      "began to slake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer,\n",

      "reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags. The brown and\n",
      "charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently recognised as the\n",
      "decaying vestiges of books. They had long since dropped to pieces, and\n",
      "every semblance of print had left them. But here and there were warped\n",

      "all ambition. But as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force\n",

      "caught the same queer sound and voices I had heard in the Underworld.\n",
      "There were evidently several of the Morlocks, and they were closing in upon\n",

      "fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of the Morlocks in\n",
      "flight amid the trees. I hastily took a lump of camphor from my pocket, and\n",
      "prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane. Then I looked at\n",
      "Weena. She was lying clutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face\n",
      "to the ground. With a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely\n",
      "to breathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground, and as\n",
      "it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the shadows, I knelt\n",

      "For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the Palace of Green\n",
      "Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to think rapidly what to\n",
      "do. I determined to build a fire and encamp where we were. I put Weena,\n",
      "still motionless, down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily, as my first\n",
      "lump of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks and leaves. Here and there\n",

      "One was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I felt\n",
      "his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of dismay,\n",
      "staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece of camphor, and\n",
      "went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry was some of the\n",
      "foliage above me, for since my arrival on the Time Machine, a matter of a\n",
      "week, no rain had fallen. So, instead of casting about among the trees for\n",
      "fallen twigs, I began leaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I\n",
      "had a choking smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economise\n",
      "my camphor. Then I turned to where Weena lay beside my iron mace. I tried\n",
      "what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I could not even\n",
      "satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have\n",

      "My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I felt very weary\n",
      "after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was full of a slumbrous\n",

      "But all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands upon me. Flinging off\n",
      "their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for the match-box,\n",
      "and—it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me again. In a\n",
      "moment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and\n",
      "the bitterness of death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the\n",
      "smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms,\n",
      "and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to feel all\n",
      "these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in a monstrous\n",
      "spider’s web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt little teeth\n",
      "nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my hand came against my\n",
      "iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled up, shaking the human rats\n",
      "from me, and, holding the bar short, I thrust where I judged their faces\n",
      "might be. I could feel the succulent giving of flesh and bone under my\n",
      "blows, and for a moment I was free.\n",

      "“The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard\n",
      "fighting came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I\n",
      "determined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my back to\n",
      "a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was full of the\n",
      "stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices seemed to rise to a\n",
      "higher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet none came\n",
      "within reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came hope.\n",
      "What if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that came a\n",
      "strange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to\n",
      "see the Morlocks about me—three battered at my feet—and then I\n",
      "recognised, with incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an\n",
      "incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the wood\n",
      "in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish. As I stood\n",
      "agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight\n",
      "between the branches, and vanish. And at that I understood the smell of\n",
      "burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar,\n",

      "was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud as each\n",
      "fresh tree burst into flame, left little time for reflection. My iron bar\n",
      "still gripped, I followed in the Morlocks’ path. It was a close race.\n",
      "Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was\n",
      "outflanked and had to strike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a\n",
      "small open space, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me,\n",

      "\n",

      "day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock or\n",
      "tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was another arm of\n",
      "the burning forest, with yellow tongues already writhing from it,\n",
      "completely encircling the space with a fence of fire. Upon the hillside\n",
      "were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat, and\n",
      "blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment. At\n",
      "first I did not realise their blindness, and struck furiously at them with\n",
      "my bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they approached me, killing one and\n",
      "crippling several more. But when I had watched the gestures of one of them\n",
      "groping under the hawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, I\n",

      "time the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would\n",
      "presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the fight by\n",
      "killing some of them before this should happen; but the fire burst out\n",
      "again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about the hill among them\n",
      "and avoided them, looking for some trace of Weena. But Weena was gone.\n",

      "uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat on them. The\n",
      "coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and through the rare\n",
      "tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to another\n",
      "universe, shone the little stars. Two or three Morlocks came blundering\n",

      "one!”\n",

      "He caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the\n",
      "door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering light of\n",
      "the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a thing of\n",
      "brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz. Solid to the\n",
      "touch—for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it—and with\n",
      "brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon the\n",
      "lower parts, and one rail bent awry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand\n",
      "along the damaged rail. “It’s all right now,” he said.\n",
      "“The story I told you was true. I’m sorry to have brought you\n",
      "out here in the cold.” He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute\n",
      "silence, we returned to the smoking-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat.\n",
      "The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation, told\n",
      "him he was suffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely. I remember\n",
      "him standing in the open doorway, bawling good-night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a “gaudy\n",
      "lie.” For my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story\n",
      "was so fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay\n",
      "awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go next day and\n",
      "see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the laboratory, and\n",
      "being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory,\n",
      "however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and put out\n",
      "my hand and touched the lever. At that the squat substantial-looking mass\n",
      "swayed like a bough shaken by the wind. Its instability startled me\n",
      "extremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of the childish days when I used\n",
      "to be forbidden to meddle. I came back through the corridor. The Time\n",
      "Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had\n",
      "a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed\n",
      "when he saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. “I’m frightfully\n",
      "busy,” said he, “with that thing in there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“But is it not some hoax?” I said. “Do you really\n",
      "travel through time?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really and truly I do.” And he looked frankly into my eyes.\n",
      "He hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. “I only want half an\n",
      "hour,” he said. “I know why you came, and it’s awfully\n",
      "good of you. There’s some magazines here. If you’ll stop to\n",
      "lunch I’ll prove you this time travelling up to the hilt, specimens\n",
      "and all. If you’ll forgive my leaving you now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words, and\n",
      "he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the laboratory\n",
      "slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper. What was he\n",
      "going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly I was reminded by an\n",
      "advertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson, the publisher, at\n",
      "two. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely save that\n",
      "engagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the Time\n",
      "Traveller.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly\n",
      "truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled round\n",
      "me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken glass\n",
      "falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed to see a\n",
      "ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black and brass\n",
      "for a moment—a figure so transparent that the bench behind with its\n",
      "sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I\n",
      "rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of\n",
      "dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight\n",
      "had, apparently, just been blown in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had\n",
      "happened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing\n",
      "might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened, and the\n",
      "man-servant appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. “Has Mr.\n",
      "—— gone out that way?” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find\n",
      "him here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed\n",
      "on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps still\n",
      "stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring with him.\n",
      "But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime. The Time\n",
      "Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows now, he has\n",

      "One cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he\n",
      "swept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy savages\n",
      "of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the Cretaceous Sea; or\n",
      "among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian brutes of the Jurassic\n",
      "times. He may even now—if I may use the phrase—be wandering on\n",
      "some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or beside the lonely saline\n",
      "seas of the Triassic Age. Or did he go forward, into one of the nearer\n",
      "ages, in which men are still men, but with the riddles of our own time\n",
      "answered and its wearisome problems solved? Into the manhood of the race:\n",
      "for I, for my own part, cannot think that these latter days of weak\n",
      "experiment, fragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed man’s\n",
      "culminating time! I say, for my own part. He, I know—for the question\n",
      "had been discussed among us long before the Time Machine was\n",
      "made—thought but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw\n",
      "in the growing pile of civilisation only a foolish heaping that must\n",
      "inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If that is so,\n",
      "it remains for us to live as though it were not so. But to me the future is\n",
      "still black and blank—is a vast ignorance, lit at a few casual places\n",
      "by the memory of his story. And I have by me, for my comfort, two strange\n",
      "white flowers—shrivelled now, and brown and flat and brittle—to\n",
      "witness that even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual\n",
      "tenderness still lived on in the heart of man.\n"
